## STEP ONE: Planning
*Planning is often one of the most important steps in most jobs. This step saves you massive amounts of time and personal misery.*

* Plan the following:
    - What websites you would like to include in the "App Dock"
    - The structure of your project folder
        * Example: 
```
            **PROJECT FOLDER**           
            |-startpage.html
            |-scripts.js
            |-style.css
            |
            -media-|
                   |-background.jpg
                   |-aws-icon.jpg
                   |-github-icon.jpg
                   |-office365-icon.jpg
                   |-linkedin-icon.jpg
```
